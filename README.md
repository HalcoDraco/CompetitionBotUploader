# CompetitionBotUploader
The aim of this project is to create both a python-based server and game.

The server, based on flask, can provide users different capabilities including login, and code and options saving for an arena-type competitive game, which will be periodically and asynchronously run, after which the needed data for improvement will be released.

As for the game, the intention is to create a game-frame from scratch using pygame, upon which we can add all the functionalities needed for the base game, and whatever updates we think of in the future.
